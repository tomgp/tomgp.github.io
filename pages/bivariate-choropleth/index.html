  <h1>Bivariate Choropleths Maps: A Why-not Guide</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I put this page together in response to what I saw as a gap in Josh Stevens' otherwise excellent tutorial: <a href="http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/">Bivariate Choropleth Maps: A How-to Guide</a> i.e. what are the draw backs of such an approch from an information design perspective and what other methods are be available for showing similar information.</p>
    <p class="note">(A choropleth is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income.</a>)</p>

    <h2>From Edward Tufte's <i>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</i>:</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Complexity of multifunctioning elements can sometimes turn data graphics into visual puzzles, crypto-graphical mysteries for the viewer to decode. A sure sign of a puzzle is that the graphic must be interpreted through a verbal rather than a visual process.</p>
      <p>For example, despite its clever multifunctioning data measure, formed by crossing two four-color grids, this is a puzzle graphic. Deployed here, in a feat of technological virtuosity, are 16 shades of color spread on 3,056 counties, a monument to a sophisticated computer graphics system<sup>1</sup>. But it is surely a graphic experienced verbally, not visually. Over and over, the viewers must run little phrases through their minds, trying to make sense out of the visual montage: <br>&#8220;Now let's see, purple represents counties where there are both high levels of male cardiovascular disease mortality <i>and</i> 11.6 to 56.0 percent of households have more than 1.01 persons per room. &hellip;What does that mean anyway?..And the yellow-green counties&hellip;&#8221;<br> By contrast, in a non-puzzle graphic, the translation of visual image flows right <i>through</i> the verbal decoder initially necessary to understand the graphic. As Paul Val√©ry wrote, &#8220;seeing is forgetting the name of the thing one sees&#8221;</p>

    <p>So bivariate choropleths can be slow to read but what should we use instead? As always the answer is that it depends on what you want to show and if you want to show several different things you may need several different graphics. If you're interested in exploring geographical distribution how about two separate coropleth maps, one for each variable? In Stevens' original post he presents this image: <img class="inline" src="choro-math.png"> For me the two maps on the left are much easier to read than the combined figure on the right. For example, on the second map there's a very obvious gap at the bottom &mdash; around Texas, New Mexico etc. This is major feature of the data's spatial distribution but it' i's really hard to spot given only the bi-variate map. The final image is less than the sum of its parts. On the other hand, if your aim is to explore the relationship between two variables how about a scatter plot? This would make it significantly easier to see any correlation by allowing you to encode values in space rather than in colour. Space is a much better dimension for comparison than colour which is best used to encode <a href="http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=Visual_Variables#Characteristics">selective variables rather than a quantitaive ones</a>.</p>
    <p>In short, there are probably good uses of this type of map but they're rare.</p>
