<section class="intro">
	<p>
		This is my personal website where you'll find things I've written, things I've made, and at the bottom of this page <a href="#contact">contact details</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I live in North London, zone 3. On the whole I prefer bikes to cars, board games to video games, fiction to non-fiction, and vegetables to meat.
