	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>
		Right now I'm working in the interactive graphics team at the <a href="http://www.ft.com">Financial Times</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Previously I was the principal developer on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/">BBC news website</a>'s  visual journalism team. <!--I built systems to display election results, created the popular Seat Calculator application and made countless graphics, charts and maps for breaking stories, longer form investigative pieces and contextual articles.-->

		Freelance projects I've enjoyed working on include visualising chess games for the world chess championships, loyalty card data for a huge supermarket chain, and making a map of Rwanda.
